3. **Summary**   
    I’m an engineer according to my university  degree, and I can definitely say I keen on smth like electrical circuitsatics or configurations. Unfortunately, because of personal reasons I had to change activity field  and I’ve become a sales manager. Two years ago I decided to continue working in my technical specialty. I studied all the possible courses, trainings, passed additional education. Later I realized that development area is much  closer for me. Therefore, I applied for BSUIR retraining courses. Considering my work experience (including the sales field), I can definitely say I’m a hardworking person with good communication skills. I like to set goals and see real results of my work.
